# COVID-19-Forecasting

A Time Series Forecasting of COVID-19 Cases Using LSTM Neural Network.

## COVID-19 Case Forecasting

This project documents a complete data analysis workflow, starting from raw data and culminating in a forecasting model. The goal is to process and understand COVID-19 case data to build a tool that can provide future projections. The journey begins with data ingestion and cleaning, moves through detailed exploration and visualization, and concludes with the application of a neural network to predict future trends.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from the COVID-19 Stream Data dataset, created by H. Gultekin and available on Kaggle.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:**  
  I start by reading and normalizing raw COVID-19 data from a JSON file, getting it ready for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  This section examines the data's characteristics. This includes checking data types, handling missing values, and generating descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's contents.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Charts are created to show the data. This includes:  
  - Bar charts showing top countries by cases and deaths.  
  - A pie chart to see the continental case distribution.  
  - Line charts to track mon
